# Self-Irrigation-Proejct
Developing an Arduino automatic irrigation system based on soil moisture percentage for our final project on 'AgroTech Laboratory' course.
On top of the Irrigation system we've built an expiriment to check the Leaf tempeture depending on the amounts of irrigation.

GOALS -
1. Reading soil mositure precentage frequently.
2. Creating an automatic switch that responds to the soil mostioure prectage.
3. Reading ambient and leaf surface tempeture.
4. Checking for coorolation between leaf surface tempeture by soil mositure pretantage.


HARDWARE -
1. ESP32 
2. Adafruit_MLX90614 x2 (infrared tempeture sensor)
3. Soil Moisture Sensor X2
4. Electric switches x2
5. PowerSupply 12V
6. Buck
7. Electoric Taps x2
